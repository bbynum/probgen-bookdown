## Introduction {#introduction}

While permutations count ordered arrangements, combinations are unordered collections of items.


## Chapter Scenario - Three Counting Problems and an Algebra Problem {#chapter_scenario_three_counting_problems}

Below are three counting problems and one algebra problem. On the surface these appear to be unrelated problems but can you find a deep connection between them? It might help to team up with classmates to gain multiple perspectives. 

Problem 1: Write down all the possible birth orderings for a family of three boys and two girls (for example, BGBBG is one of them).

Problem 2: Find the number of ways that you can walk along the blocks from point A to point B by a path of shortest length.

```

Problem 3: How many ways could two captains be chosen from the five starting members of a basketball team?

Problem 4: Expand the following: $(p + q)^{5}$.

## Example - From Class Line-up to Class Committee {#example_class_lineup_to_class_committee}

If we were to select four people from our class of 20 and line them up, this could be done $P(20,4)=20!/16!=20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17$ ways. But if we are interested in the number of unordered committees of four rather than ordered line-ups we notice that for each selection of four people, there were $4!=4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$ line-ups counted so the number of unordered committees is $(20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17)/(4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1)$. 

We call an undordered collection of k objects selected from n distinct objects a combination and use the notation $\dbinom{n}{k}$. A simple way to think of this is to find the permutation of k objects selected from n objects, $P(n,k)=n!/(n-k)!$ and divide out the order, $k!$. Putting all this together we get the following formula.

## Combination Formula

The number of unordered collections of k objects selected from n distinct objects is 

$$\dbinom{n}{k}=\frac{P(n,k)}{k!}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}=
\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)...3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}$$

Using this notation to recap the number of unordered committees selected from 20 students we see

$$\dbinom{20}{4}=\frac{20!}{16! \cdot 4!}=\frac{20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}$$
